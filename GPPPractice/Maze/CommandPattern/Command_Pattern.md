# Command Pattern

See: [Command](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)

1) Using the code from the `/Maze` folder, refactor the code to use a command pattern for handling the north, east, south, west commands.
2) Implement a new command 'undo' which will move the player back to their previous location.
3) Implement a 'replay' option at the end of the game which replays the game as the player played it with a 1 second delay between each action.
