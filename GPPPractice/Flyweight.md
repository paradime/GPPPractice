# Flyweight

See: [Flyweight](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/flyweight.html)

1) Using code from the `/Maze` folder, refactor the board's tile implementation using the flyweight. Your code should no longer reference the `room_tile` enum.
    - hint: There should only be 5 different object instances
2) With the flyweight models, refactor the `PrintBoard` code to allow the tile to handle how it should represent itself in the board.
